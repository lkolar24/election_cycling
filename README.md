# Data from *Election Cycling* 

Bike infrastructure and election data are messy, decentralized, and difficult. As such, one contribution I hope to make is allowing for easier use and analysis at the intersection of these subjects.

Included in this repository are clean data sets for the public domain. Additionally, each `.Rmd` file, I include code for recreating my analyses and figures. 

Though my full code is not included, I am working on turning many of my important functions - including walkshed calculations, longitudinal precinct join algorithms, functions for projecting block group features onto precincts, and more - into a standalone `R` package. In the meantime, you can reach me at <lukekolar@college.harvard.edu>.

Below are the data sets by chapter; for underlying data sources, see descriptions in the `tables` folder.
