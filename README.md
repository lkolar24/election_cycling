# Election Cycling

My senior thesis, *Election Cycling: Quantifying the Impact of Bike Infrastructure on Local Elections and Democracy*, involves several analyses drawing from many data sources. Included in this are clean data sets for either replicating my work in final stages or performing your own. Additionally, in `.Rmd` files is code for recreating most of the figures I used. 

Below are the data sets by chapter; for underlying data sources, see descriptions in the `tables` folder.
