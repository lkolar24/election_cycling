# Data from *Election Cycling* 

Bike infrastructure and election data are messy, decentralized, and difficult. Being passionate about both data science and these subjects, one contribution I hope to make is allowing for easier use and analysis of cycling and elections. Included in this repository are publicly available, finalized data sets. Additionally, each `.Rmd` file, I include code for recreating my analyses and figures. 

Importantly, these draw on many underlying data sources. These are cited in my senior thesis, but I also include these in individual data set descriptions (see the `tables` folder). Below are the data sets included by chapter and their purpose.

Though my full code is not included, I am working on turning many of my important functions - including functions for computing infrastructure walksheds, longitudinal precinct joins, population-weighted block group feature projection onto precincts, and more - into a standalone `R` package. In the meantime, you can reach me at <lukekolar@college.harvard.edu> for my existing (messier) version of these.
